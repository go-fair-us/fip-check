## Overview
FIP Check is a structured, rubric-based assessment tool designed to evaluate **FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs)** through their declared **FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs)**.
Rather than assessing datasets or repositories as a whole, FIP Check focuses on the individual enabling technologies, standards, and policies that communities declare in their FIPs—providing a granular, Principle-aligned, and constructive measure of FAIRness.

By integrating the concept of _partial FAIRness_, transparent evaluation criteria, and weighting, FIP Check enables:
- Targeted FAIRness improvement planning
- Cross-community comparison and analysis
- Transparent and reviewable assessments
- Visualization of FIP and FAIR alignment across repositories and domains



## How it works
1. **Make a copy of the template**
   Use the link at the top of this README to create your own editable copy of the FIP Check Google Sheet.
2. **Import your FER list**  
   Export your FIP’s FERs from the FIP Wizard and paste/import them into the **`FIP Assessment`** tab.
3. **Assess each FER**  
   For every listed FER, open its dedicated tab and answer the **Principle-aligned questions** using dropdowns.  
   Choose a scoring scheme:
   - **Standard (5-point):** 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 (captures partial FAIRness)
   - **Simplified (binary):** 0 or 100 (fast pass/fail style)
4. **Review results**  
   Aggregated scores appear in **`FIP Assessment`**, organized by FIP, FAIR Principle Category, FAIR Principle, and FER.  
   Scores are translated into friendly **FAIR Ratings**: Beginning • Basic • Core • Advanced • Exemplary.
5. **Tune weights & visualize**  
   Optionally adjust **principle weights** to reflect local priorities.  
   Feel free to use the charts provided in this GitHub repository to communicate FAIR alignment across repositories and divisions.
